# Share The Dream of Christmas
## WordPress Theme
This repository contains the WordPress theme developed for christmas.sharethedreamwi.org. Share the Dream of Christmas is a local nonprofit organization that donates gifts and meals to families in need during the holiday season. For their main website, they required a simple yet informative platform that effectively communicates their nonprofitâ€™s mission and encourages site visitors to make donations. Additionally, they sought an invitation-only registration system to facilitate the sign-up process for low-income families interested in participating in the event.

## Registration API
The registration API includes several php files that interact with the database. I make API requests using the JavaScript fetch API.
